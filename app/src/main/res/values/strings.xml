    <!-- FAQ Answer Strings -->
    <string name="answer1">Although some authorities claim there is, the final halachah is that it is not a mitzvah, but it is still a very nice thing to do.</string>
    <string name="answer2">Yes, by way of the product code. For example, a code appearing as 06 273 2 indicates that the product was processed on the 2nd shift, day 273, year 2006. Similarly, the code 07 027 1 indicates processing on the 1st shift, day 27, year 2007.</string>
    <string name="answer3">Yes. Shmittah produce from Eretz Yisrael retains its kedushah even when exported. Therefore, up to thirty percent of the flowers sold in the United States are imported from Israel, and if they have a scent and were grown during shmittah, they may be forbidden, depending upon where they came from within Israel. And, Israeli fruit is sold commonly throughout Europe, and plenty makes its way to America as well. One must therefore consult local kashrus authorities for details. One must be especially watchful for vegetables that were exported from Eretz Yisrael, which is very common, since they may be forbidden to eat because of sefichim and other problems.</string>
    <string name="answer4">Yes. During the shmittah year (and for some time after) there are a great many factors and halachos involved, so it is very important to look for a trustworthy hechsher.</string>
    <string name="answer5">Yes, even though some of the food may be wasted. They should not, however, be given to a very young child that will play with them and thereby waste them. Care should be taken to give the child only that which he will eat, not extra which is likely to be wasted. Children (from the age of understanding) should be taught not to ruin/destroy food with kedushas sheviis.</string>
    <string name="answer6">Yes, provided that they are normally eaten this way. Thus, any fruit that is normally eaten raw (oranges, avocado, lettuce) may only be eaten raw, and fruit that is normally cooked (potato, squash, etc.) may not be eaten raw. Normal is defined as what many people do, even if it is not done by the majority.</string>
    <string name="answer7">Yes, if it is normally done. Similarly, one may put spices – even if they can be eaten by themselves – into a mixture of other food for taste. The leftover cake that has this orange or grape juice in it may not be thrown away or wasted.</string>
    <string name="answer8">Yes</string>
    <string name="answer9">Any food that is still fit for human consumption [or even animal consumption] – even if no-one actually intends to eat it – or peels and pits that have some edible food clinging to them may not be destroyed. Consequently, they may not be thrown normally into a bin containing other food and refuse that would render them inedible. Rather, one should have in one’s kitchen a dedicated shmittah bin into which one may place all the leftover food and wait until the food begins to rot; at that point one may dispose of the leftovers normally, since at this stage it is no longer fit for human consumption and has lost its kedushah. Another reason to have a shmittah bin is that it is disrespectful toward food that has kedushah to be thrown into a receptacle for dirty or mouldy items. -1- The bag in the bin should be changed every day or every few days depending on the usage; or the new food should be placed into a bag before being put into the bin so that it will not be destroyed by leftovers which have earlier been placed there and have already grown mouldy. -2-In a situation where having a shmittah bin is difficult, one may simply place the food in a plastic bag, seal the top, and place it into the regular bin, allowing the food to rot by itself. -3- Food may be removed from the shmittah bin and discarded normally once it has spoiled to the point of being inedible.</string>
    <string name="answer10">Yes</string>
    <string name="answer11">Any food that is still fit for human consumption should not be fed to animals. Once it is no longer fit for people, it may be given to animals. If one wishes to take shmittah food to feed to the animals, one should do so only with food that is no longer fit for human consumption.</string>
    <string name="answer12">Animal food with kedushas sheviis must be given to animals and may not be discarded in the normal way.</string>
    <string name="answer13">No.</string>
    <string name="answer14">No. One may even give shmittah produce to a non-Jewish worker working in one’s house as a snack, provided it is not part of his payment for the job</string>
    <string name="answer15">If the remnants are insignificant such that they would usually not be gathered and saved, the dishes may be washed normally without regard for the remnants. If, however, they are significant enough such that one might gather and save them, they should be treated with kedusha and placed in the shmittah bin before the dishes are washed.</string>
    <string name="answer16">Yes.  However, one should place a plate under the cup to catch whatever spills and pour it back into the cup or it should be drunk. Also, the candle may not be extinguished in the wine, and wine may not be dabbed into one’s pockets and upon the eyes.</string>
    <string name="answer17">No. however, since the money one may receive as change from the till may be ‘shmittah’ money (i.e., it was used by someone to buy shmittah produce), it must only be used for food items and eaten as shmittah. If the majority of the store sells non shmittah produce, one need not be concerned every time he receives change from this store.</string>
    <string name="answer18">No, the money used to buy foods with kedushas sheviis from a non-Jew do not become shmittah money.</string>
    <string name="answer19">Some allow it if the food that was originally borrowed was also of shmittah. Nevertheless, the most preferable option when borrowing or repaying is to specify that the object being transferred is merely a gift. Thus, when one returns what one borrowed, it is not a debt being re-paid, but a present being given.</string>
    <string name="answer20">Flowers that are primarily valued for their beauty and emit no fragrance do not have kedushas sheviis. Some say that they even if such flowers do emit a fragrance, they do not have kedushas sheviis.In all cases, flowers may be smelled [except if they are sefichim according to some opinions].</string>
    <string name="answer21">Since the flowers one buys are mainly for beauty purposes, they do not have kedushah, and may be thrown away normally.</string>
    <string name="answer22">No. They may only be bought from a store that keeps the halachos of shmittah such that we can be assured they were not planted, tended to, or harvested in a forbidden way. If one did buy or received flowers from a questionable source, one may still use them normally. When buying a plant during shmittah from a store that keeps the laws of shmittah, some require that a plastic bag be placed all around the plant while transporting it home to prevent it from receiving nourishment from the ground (which would be like planting it).</string>
    <string name="answer23">They may be placed into a vase of water, even if this will cause the flower to open up</string>
    <string name="answer24">Yes</string>
    <string name="answer25">Yes – provided the boards are out showing clearly ones intention is only to make sitting in the succah easier and not to work the land in any way. Additionally, one should use non professional tools.</string>
    <string name="answer26">Yes, provided it is not done in a professional manner.</string>
    <string name="answer27">Absolutely not. There is a difference if the flowerpot is getting nourishment from the ground or not, and whether the place it will be moved to is a place where it can receive nourishment. This requires a lot of information.one should consult a rav before moving plants around – even in ones house.</string>
